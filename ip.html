                            It is important to understand what an IP address is. IP stands for
                            Internet
                            Protocol and is
                            an address that is assigned to each domain on the web (for example: 216.58.217.206).
                            The "address" part refers to a unique number that gets linked to all online activity you
                            do...somewhat like a return address on a letter you'd send out and all this happens in
                            milliseconds.
                            we're always connected through our personal computers, laptops or mobile devices. And every
                            time you go on the Internet, an IP address is right there, working for you.
                            This number is used to help devices talk to each other and exchange data. Your network
                            router has its own IP address, of course, as does every device on your network.
                            They are mapped to domain names using what’s called the DNS.
                            You can think of the DNS as a phone book for the world wide web. When you type Google.com
                            into your address bar, a DNS query is performed by your ISP to request the nameservers
                            associated with that domain.
                            The mapping to the IP address is then done behind the scenes by the server, which allows you
                            to use the domain name to access it. Without DNS, you would have to type in something like
                            “216.58.217.206” to get to Google.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Currently, there are two types of IP addresses being used on the web, and even locally by
                            ISPs and devices such as your home router. They are IPv4 and IPv6<br /><br />
                            Example of IPv4 address: 216.58.217.206<br /><br />
                            Example of IPv6 address: 0:0:0:0:0:ffff:d83a:d9ce<br /><br />
                            A dedicated IP address is just what it sounds like: it means your domain is assigned an IP
                            address that isn’t shared or used by any other domains. It’s your domain’s home on the
                            web.<br />
                            A shared IP address, unlike a dedicated one, means your domain is mapped to an address that
                            is shared between multiple domains. A shared IP is quite common nowadays with most WordPress
                            hosting providers.

                            That’s because, for many configurations, there is no need for a dedicated IP address.

                        <p>
                            Your IP address can reveal your geographic location. In most cases, this won't be any
                            more specific than your city and state. In rare cases, it could be as specific as your
                            neighborhood. Your IP address also carries the name of your Internet Service Provider
                            (the company that gives you internet access).
                            While there's not a lot someone can do with this information, it can be combined with
                            details from other sources to piece together data about your identity.

                        <h3> Can anyone find me with my ip?
                        </h3>
                        <p>When you connect to the internet through your Internet Service Provider(ISP) you are assigned
                            an IP address. Your IP address is similar to your mailing address, but for your computer, on
                            the internet. The IP address routes internet traffic to your computer. To clarify, it does
                            not reveal your location. If someone was able to get your IP address they could learn a bit
                            about your internet service, such as which provider you use to connect to the internet, but
                            they really can't locate you, your home, or your office</p>
                        <p>In some circumstances they may locate the city you are in, or perhaps a nearby city, but they
                            will not have your physical address. Once they trace you back to your ISP they will lose
                            your trail. While strangers may not be able to find you, your ISP knows where you are. ISPs
                            will generally go to great lengths to protect you and your privacy but they do keep logs of
                            your connections.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To clarify, with one big exception found. If you were to participate in illegal activities
                            then a law enforcement agency can get a court order and submit it to your ISP to request
                            your information. One way you can be found is with the involvement of law enforcement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, the simple answer is no. If someone was to get your IP address they can not find
                            you. There are other ways you can be located but this isn't one of them. Posting your name
                            and town online to social media would more likely tracked than by your IP address.

                                    reach a certain site, or to post messages in forums or the comment section of
                                    web sites.

                                    normal traffic from getting through and overloads the network's ability to
                                    function.However, these attacks are usually directed at large companies or
                                    websites... it's rare that anyone would set up a DoS attack on a regular user.

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):
                                <p>This protects your data online by the use of encryption and proxy tunneling. It hides
                                    your IP address and redirects your traffic through a separate server, making it much
                                    safer for you online.
                                    VPN services are best practice for hiding your IP address. There are free VPN
                                    services out there, but don’t expect them to be fast enough for any streaming or
                                    gaming.
                                </p>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Update your router and firewall rules
                                <p>Your router forwards data between networks, and your firewall prevents unauthorized
                                    access. Make sure you change the administrative password on your router, since
                                    default passwords are frequently used by attackers to break into your network. Each
                                    default password provided by your ISP is the same and can be easily searched online.
                                    Also, set your firewall rules to not allow any ping requests from the Internet. This
                                    makes sure unauthorized visitors won’t get through.

                                </p>
                            </li>

                                Change privacy settings on instant messaging applications
                                <p>Only allow direct connections from contacts and don’t accept calls or messages from
                                    people you don’t know. Changing your settings to private makes it harder to find
                                    your IP address because people who don’t know you cannot connect with you.

                                </p>
                            </li>

                                Update your antivirus solution and add security layers
                                <p>Making sure you are caught up on all of your security software’s updates ensures
                                    you’re protected from threats. Adding additional security on top of your antivirus
                                    further protects you. For instance, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware blocks malicious URLs
                                    originating from phishing emails in addition to blocking bad sites you might
                                    encounter.
