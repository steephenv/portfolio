                            You might have encountered terms like encryption, hashing, salting, keys etc. let’s get our
                            basics right with these terms and how encryption and hashing
                            is an integral part of any application you use or see
                            let’s talk about the difference between encryption and hashing ,

                        </p>

                            <strong> What is Encryption ? and Why Encryption
                            </strong><br />
                            To put it simply, encryption is the process of using a code to stop other parties from
                            accessing information. When data has been encrypted, only those who have the key can access
                            it. As long as a sufficiently complicated system is used, and it’s used correctly, then
                            attackers are prevented from seeing the data.

                            Data is encrypted with encryption algorithms, which are also known as ciphers. One of the
                            most important distinctions between encryption and hashing (which we will get to later) is
                            that encryption is designed to go both ways. This means that once something has been
                            encrypted with a key, it can also be decrypted.

                            This makes encryption useful in a range of situations, such as for securely storing or
                            transferring information. Once data has been encrypted properly, it is considered secure and
                            can only be accessed by those who have the key.
                            Encryption is scrambling information in a way that only someone with a corresponding
                            key can unscramble and read it. Encryption is a two-way function. When you encrypt
                            something,
                            you’re doing so with the intention of decrypting it later.<br />
                            To encrypt data you use something called a cipher, which is an algorithm ,
                            a series of well-defined steps that can be followed procedurally
                            – to encrypt and decrypt information. The algorithm can also be called the encryption key.

                        <h3> Encryption Working Concept
                        </h3><br />
                        <strong> Cipher Suites ( Basic understanding )

                        </strong><br /><br />

                        <p>A cipher is really just an algorithm, or a set of steps that are used to perform a specific
                            mathematical function –
                            be that encryption, hashing or digital signatures. Ciphers have always had a basis in math.
                        </p>
                        <p>lets take Caesar’s cipher to explain some basic concepts that will be useful for us when we
                            get into modern cipher suites.
                            Anyway, that original unencrypted piece of data would be referred to as the plaintext, as
                            it’s easily readable in its raw form.
                            After the encryption process has been performed, it becomes a piece of ciphertext and should
                            ideally be unreadable to anyone without the private key.
                        </p>
                        <p>Encryption is performed by keys, but it’s important to square how keys and algorithms/ciphers
                            are been used.
                            The algorithm or cipher used is just that, it’s a sequence of steps that must be used to
                            encrypt the plaintext.
                            Depending on the cryptosytem, either the values within that algorithm, or the value the
                            algorithm arrives at itself, are the keys.
                            The algorithms are the general principles/rules used by a given cryptosystem, the keys are
                            what actually performs the function.
                        </p>
                        <p>it’s best to illustrate with an example so let’s go back to Caesar’s cipher and illustrate.
                            In Caesar’s cipher, the actual algorithm is:</p>
                        <h3>e ( x ) = ( x + k ) ( mod 26 ) </h3>

                        <p> where x represents the raw input, in this case x refers to whatever letter we’re shifting ,
                            e(x) represents the encrypted value , k represents the key, mod represents the modulus
                        </p>
                        <p>In Caesar’s cipher, the key is simply the number of spaces you decide to shift the letters.
                            So, in the example below the key would be 3. We’re shifting everything three spaces forward.
                        </p>
                        <h3> e ( x ) = ( x + 3 ) ( mod 26 ) </h3>
                        <h4>A B C D E... (x3)</h4>
                        <p>Now let’s add in the modulus. Modular arithmetic wraps around after it reaches the modulus,
                            which is basically the end of the line, the number cap – however you want to think about it.
                            With the alphabet, the modulus is obviously 26. There are 26 letters, so if you want to move
                            a “Y” three spaces forward you have to wrap around and start back at 1 (or A) again. So in
                            this instance, the equation would be B = (Y + 3)(mod 26).
                        </p>
                        <h4> Y Z A B C...
                        </h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">

                            <h3>Modern Ciphers & Cipher Suites
                            </h3>
                            <p> It’s no different at the digital level. The math is far more complicated now – no human
                                could do it efficiently – but the concept is still the same. It’s all just math. Now
                                let’s apply what we learned about algorithms in general to SSL/TLS and HTTPS
                                connections.
                                An HTTPS connection is actually a fairly complicated process.consider TLS handshake ,
                                This is the process where a client and server agree on a mutually support cipher suite
                                and then use the chosen cipher suite to negotiate a secure connection.
                                Part of what makes the handshake so complicated is that it leverages several different
                                cryptographic functions to achieve the HTTPS connection. During the handshake, the
                                client and server will use ,
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    A key exchange algorithm
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A bulk encryption cipher
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A digital signature scheme
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A Hash/MAC function
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p> These ciphers all work together at various points to perform authentication, key
                                generation and exchange and a check-sum to ensure integrity.
                            </p>
                            <p>In order to determine what specific algorithms to use, the client and server start by
                                deciding on a cipher suite to use. Cipher suites are collections of these algorithms
                                that can work together to perform the handshake and the encryption/decryption that
                                follows. At the outset of the connection both parties share a list of supported cipher
                                suites and then decide on the most secure, mutually supported suite.
                            </p>

                            <p>Today, thanks to computer technology and the internet we can now practice public key
                                cryptography. With public key cryptography, one public key is used to encrypt and the
                                other private key is used to decrypt. You see this during the SSL handshake, where
                                they’ve solved the historically risky issues with physical key exchange by using the
                                publicly available key to encrypt a symmetric session key and send it back to the server
                                for decryption by its private key. Well, you don’t actually see it, but you catch my
                                drift.
                            </p>
                            <p>Today, the most common forms of encryption are:</p>
                            <p><strong> Asymmetric Encryption </strong> – This is the Public Key example we just gave.
                                One key
                                encrypts,
                                the other key decrypts. The encryption only goes one way. This is the concept that forms
                                the foundation for PKI (public key infrastructure), which is the trust model that
                                undergirds SSL/TLS.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Symmetric Encryption </strong> – This is closer to a form of private key
                                encryption. Each
                                party has
                                its own key that can both encrypt and decrypt. As we discussed in the example above,
                                after the asymmetric encryption that occurs in the SSL handshake, the browser and server
                                communicate using the symmetric session key that is passed along.
                            </p>
                            <p>some of the modern encryption algorithms are:

                        <h3> Hashing </h3>
                        <p>Hashing is the practice of using an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length. This
                            is called a hash value. Whereas encryption is a two-way function, hashing is a one-way
                            function. While it’s technically possible to reverse-hash something, the computing power
                            required makes it unfeasible. Hashing is one-way.
                            Now, whereas encryption is meant to protect data in transit, hashing is used to verify file
                            or piece of data. In other words, it serves as a check-sum.</p>
                        <p>Here’s how it works, each hashing algorithm outputs at a fixed length. So for instance, you
                            may hear about SHA-256, that means that the algorithm is going to output a hash value that
                            is 256 bits, usually represented by a 64 character hexadecimal string.
                            Every hash value is unique. If two different files produce the same unique hash value this
                            is called a collision and it makes the algorithm essentially useless.</p>
                        <p>here’s an example of hashing, let’s say you want to digitally sign a piece of software and
                            make it available for download on your website. To do this, you’re going to create a hash of
                            the script or executable you’re signing, then after adding your digital signature you’ll
                            hash that, too. Following this, the whole thing is encrypted so it can be downloaded.
                        </p>
                        <p>When a customer downloads the software, their browser is going to decrypt the file, then
                            inspect the two unique hash values. The browser will then run the same hash function, using
                            the same algorithm, and hash both the file and the signature again. If the browser produces
                            the same hash value then it knows that both the signature and the file are authentic and
                            they have not been altered.

                        <h3> Salting </h3>
                        <p>Salting is a concept that typically pertains to password hashing. Essentially, it’s a unique
                            value that can be added to the end of the password to create a different hash value. This
                            adds a layer of security to the hashing process, specifically against brute force attacks. A
                            brute force attack is where a computer or number of Internet-connected devices attempt every
                            possible combination of letters and numbers until the password is found.
                            when salting, the additional value is referred to as a “salt.”</p>
                        <p>The idea is that by adding a salt to the end of a password and then hashing it, you’ve
                            essentially complicated the password cracking process.
                        </p>
                        <p>Say the password I want to salt looks like this:
                        </p>
                        <p> <strong> 7X57CKG72JVNSSS9</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your salt is just the word SALT
                        </p>
                        <p>Before hashing, you add SALT to the end of the data. So, it would look like this:
                        </p>
                        <p> <strong> 7X57CKG72JVNSSS9SALT</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>The hash value is different than it would be for just the plain unsalted password. Even the
                            slightest variation to the data being hashed will result in a different unique hash value.
                            By salting your password you’re essentially hiding its real hash value by adding an
                            additional bit of data and altering it
